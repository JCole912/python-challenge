# python-challenge
I created this code with PyCharm and had difficulty running the code on other platforms, like Spyder because it could not locate the CSV file. I tried to use the following code:
import csv
with open('election_data.csv') as file:
csv_reader:csv.reader(csv_file, delimeter=',')
but none of the systems could locate the csv files, so with the help of a Python tutor outside of Columbia Univeristy, I created another code to open the files, as shown in both "main.py" files.

Variables, for loops, and mathematical functions were inputted in my codes
